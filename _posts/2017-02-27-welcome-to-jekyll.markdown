I tested how `PIPE` is working in lunux. Understanding how PIPE works is kind of interesting to me as a lot of exploit codes use it.  

If we pass argument using pipe as below, the input is going into stdin buffer not argv1.  
> sungje.hwang@LGEARND15B13:~/hacking/pipe$ echo "1111122222333" | ./test  

My question is that how this input value is used by program if there are multiple scanf functions in the program.  
I developed simple test program as follow  
{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
 char name[5];
 char name2[5];
 char name3[3];
 
 printf("first input\n");
 scanf("%5c", name);
 
 printf("second input\n");
 scanf("%5c", name2);
 
 printf("third input\n");
 scanf("%3c", name3);
 
 printf("1=%s, 2=%s, 3=%s\n", name, name2, name3);
 return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
